Suitable panorama pictures can be created e.g. using the [Hugin](http://hugin.sourceforge.net/) panorama photo stitcher.

1. Upload the wp-photonav directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress
3. Upload a panorama picture
4. Include PhotoNav in your post by entering `[photonav url='/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/panorama.jpg']`.

== Changelog ==

= 0.7 =
* Feature: Support for popup display with ColorBox (similar to LightBox) when the jQuery Colorbox WordPress plugin is active
* Feature: Autoscroll when the parameter animate=1 is included in the shortcode
* IDs are now obsolete and ignored; instead random anchors are generated by PHP.
* Restructuring of the Javascript code: photonav is now a jQuery plugin to avoid namespace clashes

= 0.6 =
* Bugfix: All Javascript code is now properly wrapped in a jQuery.ready handler. This resolves reported issues with the Mystique theme.

= 0.5 =
* Enhancement: Horizontal 360-degree panoramas (infinite scrolling) are now supported by the 'drag360' mode.

= 0.4 =
* Bugfix: use jQuery offset() function instead of native offsetLeft and offsetTop to compute relative mouse position.

= 0.3 =
* Adds drag support: when adding shortcode option mode='drag', the panorama can be rotated by dragging it.
* Adds vertical scroll support for both, traditional 'move' and 'drag' modes. This is activated by using the container_height and photo_height shortcode options, where obviously container_height must be smaller

= 0.2 =
* Changes php source structure to object orientation
* Panorama media button as a simple shortcode helper
* I18n

= 0.1 =
* Initial release.
